# Bored-with-Web
This is being created as a class assignment; continued support and updates after the class ends will be subject to my interest in the project.

## Initial Concept (Subject to Change)
A website where games can be played with other people

- You can play a game with random people chosen from a lobby.
- You can play a game through an invite link.
- You can create an invite link to join a game and invite someone else into it.
- You can spectate a game -- either through invite, or from the lobby of ongoing games.
- While playing or spectating a game, you can chat with others doing the same (spectators chat with spectators, and players chat with players).
- If you login, statistics about your gameplay will be logged and visible to you on a statistics page.
- If you don't login, your statistics will be tracked by your session; if you login before it expires, then it will be added to your account.
- The statistics page will offer a reset button (mainly for full CRUD functionality on at least one entity).
- If you were a player of a simple game, you can spectate a replay of that game through your statistics page.
